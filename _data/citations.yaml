  description: "In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), network-wide anomaly detection\
    \ is a crucial part of monitoring IoT networks due to the inherent security vulnerabilities\
    \ of most IoT devices. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been proposed to\
    \ separate network traffics into two disjoint subspaces corresponding to normal\
    \ and malicious behaviors for anomaly detection. However, the privacy concerns\
    \ and limitations of devices\u2019 computing resources compromise the practical\
    \ effectiveness of PCA. We propose a federated PCA learning using Grassmann manifold\
    \ optimization, which coordinates IoT devices to aggregate a joint profile of\
    \ normal network behaviors for anomaly detection. First, we introduce a privacy-preserving\
    \ federated PCA framework to simultaneously capture the profile of various IoT\
    \ devices\u2019 traffic. Then, we investigate the alternating direction method\
    \ of multipliers gradient-based learning on the Grassmann manifold to guarantee\
    \ fast training and low detecting latency with limited computational resources.\
    \ Finally, we show that the computational complexity of the Grassmann manifold-based\
    \ algorithm is satisfactory for hardware-constrained IoT devices. Empirical results\
    \ on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches."
