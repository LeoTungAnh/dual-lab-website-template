  description: In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), network-wide anomaly detection is a crucial part of monitoring IoT networks due to the inherent security vulnerabilities of most IoT devices. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been proposed to separate network traffics into two disjoint subspaces corresponding to normal and malicious behaviors for anomaly detection. However, the privacy concerns and limitations of devices’ computing resources compromise the practical effectiveness of PCA. We propose a federated PCA learning using Grassmann manifold optimization, which coordinates IoT devices to aggregate a joint profile of normal network behaviors for anomaly detection. First, we introduce a privacy-preserving federated PCA framework to simultaneously capture the profile of various IoT devices’ traffic. Then, we investigate the alternating direction method of multipliers gradient-based learning on the Grassmann manifold to guarantee fast training and low detecting latency with limited computational resources. Finally, we show that the computational complexity of the Grassmann manifold-based algorithm is satisfactory for hardware-constrained IoT devices. Empirical results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches.

  title: A Federated Approach for Spatio-Temporal Data Modeling Using Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis
  type: paper
  description: In modern cyber-physical systems, the vast interconnected processes generated from sensor networks necessitate advanced modeling techniques to exploit decentralized data considering edge computation and data access issues. As sensors emit correlated real-life time series, successful forecasting hinges on revealing the spatio-temporal structures and qualities of data. Matrix Estimation-based (ME) methods, as state-of-the-art techniques, excel at denoising and forecasting high-dimensional correlated time series by representing spatio-temporal data as a temporal matrix. However, ME methods face challenges in handling the decentralized data and access restrictions, due to existing licensing agreements and the inherent burden of centralized modeling. To address this limitation, we propose the Federated Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (Fed-mSSA), a federated matrix estimation-based framework, to denoise and predict correlated time series in the presence of noisy and decentralized data. Specifically, we introduce a novel consensus optimization problem to jointly learn the low-rank matrix representation, capturing spatio-temporal patterns to recover latent states and missing data. Furthermore, we present a federated prediction method that privately and efficiently extracts non-linear temporal dynamics using the denoised temporal matrix. Our results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance in a distributed setting, particularly in the presence of missing data
