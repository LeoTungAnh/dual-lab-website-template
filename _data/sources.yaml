  description: In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), network-wide anomaly detection is a crucial part of monitoring IoT networks due to the inherent security vulnerabilities of most IoT devices. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been proposed to separate network traffics into two disjoint subspaces corresponding to normal and malicious behaviors for anomaly detection. However, the privacy concerns and limitations of devices’ computing resources compromise the practical effectiveness of PCA. We propose a federated PCA learning using Grassmann manifold optimization, which coordinates IoT devices to aggregate a joint profile of normal network behaviors for anomaly detection. First, we introduce a privacy-preserving federated PCA framework to simultaneously capture the profile of various IoT devices’ traffic. Then, we investigate the alternating direction method of multipliers gradient-based learning on the Grassmann manifold to guarantee fast training and low detecting latency with limited computational resources. Finally, we show that the computational complexity of the Grassmann manifold-based algorithm is satisfactory for hardware-constrained IoT devices. Empirical results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches.
